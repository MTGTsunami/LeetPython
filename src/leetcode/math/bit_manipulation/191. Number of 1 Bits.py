"""
Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and return the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).



Example 1:

Input: 00000000000000000000000000001011
Output: 3
Explanation: The input binary string 00000000000000000000000000001011 has a total of three '1' bits.
Example 2:

Input: 00000000000000000000000010000000
Output: 1
Explanation: The input binary string 00000000000000000000000010000000 has a total of one '1' bit.
Example 3:

Input: 11111111111111111111111111111101
Output: 31
Explanation: The input binary string 11111111111111111111111111111101 has a total of thirty one '1' bits.


Note:

Note that in some languages such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type. In this case, the input will be given as signed integer type and should not affect your implementation, as the internal binary representation of the integer is the same whether it is signed or unsigned.
In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using 2's complement notation. Therefore, in Example 3 above the input represents the signed integer -3.

If this function is called many times, how would you optimize it?

"""
We can make the previous algorithm simpler and a little faster. 
Instead of checking every bit of the number, we repeatedly flip the least-significant 11-bit of the number to 00, 
and add 11 to the sum. 
As soon as the number becomes 00, we know that it does not have any more 11-bits, and we return the sum.

The key idea here is to realize that for any number nn, 
doing a bit-wise AND of nn and n - 1nâˆ’1 flips the least-significant 11-bit in nn to 00. 
Why? Consider the binary representations of n and n - 1.

In the binary representation, the least significant 11-bit in n always corresponds to a 00-bit in n - 1. 
Therefore, anding the two numbers n and n - 1 always flips the least significant 11-bit in nn to 00, 
and keeps all other bits the same.
