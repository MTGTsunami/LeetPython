"""
Given a function rand7 which generates a uniform random integer in the range 1 to 7, write a function rand10 which generates a uniform random integer in the range 1 to 10.

Do NOT use system's Math.random().



Example 1:

Input: 1
Output: [7]
Example 2:

Input: 2
Output: [8,4]
Example 3:

Input: 3
Output: [8,1,10]


Note:

rand7 is predefined.
Each testcase has one argument: n, the number of times that rand10 is called.


Follow up:

What is the expected value for the number of calls to rand7() function?
Could you minimize the number of calls to rand7()?
